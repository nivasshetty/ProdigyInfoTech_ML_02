# 🧠 Task-02: Customer Segmentation with KMeans Clustering
This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at *Prodigy InfoTech*.

## ✅ Objective
Segment customers into meaningful groups based on:

- *Age*
- *Annual Income*
- *Spending Score*

The goal is to identify clusters that help understand customer behavior for business decision-making.

## 📊 Cluster Profiles (Sample Output)

| Cluster | Average Age | Average Annual Income (k$) | Average Spending Score |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| 0       | 50.41       | 60.47                      | 33.34                  |
| 1       | 32.85       | 87.34                      | 79.98                  |
| 2       | 25.14       | 43.27                      | 56.51                  |

### 🔍 Insights:
- *Cluster 0*: Older customers with moderate income and low spending – low engagement segment.
- *Cluster 1*: Mid-aged, high-income, high-spending – premium target segment.
- *Cluster 2*: Younger customers, average income, good spending – potential growth segment.
